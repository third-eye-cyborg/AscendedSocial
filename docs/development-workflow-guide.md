# Ascended Social Development Workflow Guide

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive guidelines for implementing the sophisticated design-to-code workflow for Ascended Social's spiritual platform development. This workflow integrates Figma MCP, Storybook, Chromatic, Browserless, and Playwright/Puppeteer for optimal spiritual platform development.

## Complete Development Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Design Creation & Token Extraction
**When to Use**: Beginning of new feature development or UI component creation

- **Components to Design**:
  - Chakra wheels and energy meters
  - Oracle cards and tarot interfaces
  - Meditation timers and spiritual dashboards
  - Aura visualizers and sigil generators
- **Design Guidelines**:
  - Use sacred color palettes (Root: red, Sacral: orange, Solar Plexus: yellow, Heart: green, Throat: blue, Third Eye: indigo, Crown: violet)
  - Implement mystical typography systems with spiritual aesthetic
  - Design responsive layouts for spiritual content and community features

#### 2. MCP Synchronization
- **Purpose**: Automatically extract design tokens and component specifications
- **Process**:
  - Automatically extract chakra colors, spiritual spacing, cosmic backgrounds
  - Sync component specifications and sacred geometry patterns
  - Enable real-time bidirectional updates between Figma and codebase
- **When to Sync**: 
  - After completing Figma designs
  - When spiritual design elements are updated
  - Before starting component development

### Phase 2: Component Development & Story Generation
**When to Use**: After design token extraction, during component implementation

#### 3. Storybook Integration

- **Validation Process**:
  - Automated screenshot comparison for spiritual components
  - Validate consistent chakra colors and mystical themes
  - GitHub integration for version-controlled design validation
  - Spiritual theme regression detection

#### 9. Production Deployment
- **Purpose**: Deploy validated components with confidence
- **Deployment Process**:

## Automation Script (Design-to-Code)

We provide an orchestration script `scripts/design-workflow.js` to run the end-to-end design-to-code pipeline:

### Usage

```bash
# Full workflow
node scripts/design-workflow.js

# Only sync from Figma
node scripts/design-workflow.js --sync-only

# Only run tests (requires Storybook at http://localhost:6006)
node scripts/design-workflow.js --test-only
```

### Runtime Notes

- The repo uses ESM (`"type": "module"`), so the script uses ESM imports and a dynamic import for `node-fetch` v3.
- The script maintains a strict allowlist of external commands to prevent command injection.
- Ensure `CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN` is present in the environment to enable Chromatic deployment steps.

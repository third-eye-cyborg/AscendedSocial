## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend
The client is built with React and TypeScript, using Vite. It utilizes a component-based architecture with shadcn/ui for UI, wouter for routing, TanStack Query for server state, and React hooks for local state.

### Backend
The backend uses Node.js/Express with TypeScript in a monorepo structure. It features session-based authentication via Replit Auth with OpenID Connect and adheres to RESTful API conventions. Recent updates include mobile authentication routing fixes to ensure proper API endpoint ordering and mobile app connectivity.

### Data Storage
PostgreSQL serves as the primary database with Drizzle ORM. Google Cloud Storage is used for media files.

### Authentication and Authorization
Authentication is managed by Replit Auth (OpenID Connect via Passport.js), with user sessions stored in PostgreSQL. Authorization uses middleware for permission checks. 

**Recent Authentication Fixes (September 2025):**
- **Resolved Authentication Middleware Conflict**: Fixed issue where enhanced security middleware was conflicting with Passport authentication, causing 401 errors on `/api/auth/user` endpoint
- **Improved Profile Loading**: Updated profile page to properly handle authentication loading states and wait for authentication completion before attempting to fetch user data
- **Enhanced Middleware Compatibility**: Modified enhanced authentication middleware to work seamlessly with both Passport web authentication and JWT mobile authentication flows

**Enhanced Mobile Authentication System:**
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Native mobile apps, mobile web apps, and desktop web
- **Platform Detection**: Automatic detection via referer headers, user agents, and query parameters
- **Smart Redirects**: Deep links for native apps, URL callbacks for web apps
- **JWT Token Management**: Secure token generation, verification, and storage
- **Domain Flexibility**: Support for development, staging, and production domains

**Mobile Authentication Endpoints:**
- `/api/auth/mobile-config` - Platform-specific configuration
- `/api/auth/mobile-login` - Cross-platform login initiation  
- `/api/auth/mobile-verify` - JWT token verification
- `/api/auth/mobile-config/health` - Service health monitoring

The system ensures seamless authentication across React Native apps with deep linking, Expo web apps with URL callbacks, and traditional web applications with session-based auth.

### Content Management
Posts are automatically categorized into seven chakra types using OpenAI's GPT-4, receiving a spiritual frequency score and chakra classification. It supports text, image, and video content.

### Engagement System
A spiritual-themed engagement system includes upvotes, downvotes, likes, and energy sharing. Users have monthly refreshing energy points for high-impact engagements.

### 3D Starmap Visualization
An immersive 3D starmap visualizes the spiritual community:
- **Starmap Mode (Macro)**: Displays large connections and chakra-based clustering.
- **Fungal Mode (Micro)**: Shows intimate connections around specific users.
Both modes provide real-time user data, interactive features, and professional visual polish using React Three Fiber and Three.js.

### Oracle System
An AI-powered oracle system, utilizing OpenAI's API, provides daily spiritual readings, personalized recommendations, and tarot-style guidance based on user behavior.

### Payment Integration
RevenueCat manages subscription lifecycle and customer data, while Paddle handles web-based checkout and payment processing for premium subscriptions, enabling features like unlimited energy and enhanced oracle readings.

### Privacy and Compliance
The platform includes comprehensive GDPR compliance with an open-source privacy stack: Klaro for cookie consent management, Fides for privacy orchestration, opt-out by default analytics (PostHog), granular cookie categorization, and data subject rights APIs. This replaces previous proprietary solutions with transparent, auditable privacy controls.

### Legal Documentation Framework
Comprehensive legal documentation provides protection and compliance for Third Eye Cyborg, LLC operations, including payment terms, copyright assignment & IP protection, community protection framework, copyright policy, service agreement, and third-party service disclaimers.

### Zero Trust Security Architecture
A four-layer security model utilizing Cloudflare Zero Trust:
- **Layer 1: User Authentication (Replit Auth)**: For standard user features.
- **Layer 2: Admin Access Protection (Zero Trust)**: Secures sensitive operations via Cloudflare Access JWT validation.
- **Layer 3: Network Protection (Cloudflare Gateway)**: Provides DNS-level filtering and threat protection.
- **Layer 4: API Protection (Web Application Firewall)**: Offers DDoS protection, rate limiting, and WAF rules for all API endpoints.

### Development Workflow
The platform employs a sophisticated design-to-code workflow integrating visual design, automated testing, and browser automation. This includes Figma for design, MCP for token extraction, Storybook for component documentation, Cypress and Playwright for testing, Browserless for authenticated browser automation, and Chromatic for visual regression testing, ensuring spiritual aesthetics and consistent user experiences.
